During the 13th week of the Trilogy University of Toronto Data Analytics & Visualization Bootcamp our Module 13 challenge is to create a written analysis with four 3 deliverables as follows; 

Here is the list of deliverables for the analysis of 3 deliverables:

- Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data
- Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data
- Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map

We will be using: 
- VS Code:  text editor to create and edit HTML and JavaScript files.JavaScript, Leaflet.js, and geoJSON data.
- Web Browser:  a web browser, such as Chrome, to view, inspect, and debug your visualizations. 
- Command-line interface: You will use the command-line interface to run a local server.  Git Bash.
- GitHub: To deploy your final data visualization on GitHub 


Specifically, 

For the challenge the files we are using are located in the The Earthquake_Challenge folder:

- index.htlm
- static folder> style.css
- js> challenge_logic.js

For the module practice with GitHub we have the following folders:
- Simple_Map
- Mapping_Single_Points
- Mapping_Multiple_Points
- Mapping_Lines
- Mapping_GeoJSON_Polygons
- Mapping_GeoJSON_Points
- Mapping_GeoJSON_Linestrings
- Earthquakes_past7days
